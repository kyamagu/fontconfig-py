## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Building fontconfig-py from source requires:

- Python 3.10 or later
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for dependency management
- C compiler (gcc, clang, or MSVC)
- Git with submodule support

**System dependencies:**

You can use your system package manager to install fontconfig and freetype (recommended for local development), or build them from source using the provided script (primarily for CI environments).

**macOS users**: You'll need to set these environment variables:

```bash
export CC=clang
export CFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/include -L/opt/homebrew/lib"
```

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork and clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/fontconfig-py.git
   cd fontconfig-py
   ```

2. **Install system dependencies:**

   **Option A: Use system packages (recommended):**

   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install fontconfig freetype pkg-config

   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get install libfontconfig1-dev libfreetype6-dev pkg-config

   # Fedora/RHEL/CentOS
   sudo dnf install fontconfig-devel freetype-devel pkgconfig
   ```

   **Option B: Build from source (CI environment):**

   ```bash
   # First, clone with submodules (if you didn't use --recurse-submodules)
   git submodule update --init --recursive

   # Build and install fontconfig and freetype from submodules
   bash scripts/build_third_party.sh
   ```

   **Note**: Option B can take several minutes and requires additional build tools (gperf, gettext, uuid libraries, automake, libtool).

3. **Install Python development dependencies:**

   ```bash
   uv sync --dev
   ```

4. **Build the Python extension:**

   ```bash
   uv build --wheel
   ```

   Or for development installation:

   ```bash
   uv sync --reinstall
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Running Tests

Run all tests with pytest:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/
```

Run a specific test file:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/test_fontconfig.py
```

Run a specific test with verbose output:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/test_fontconfig.py::test_query -v
```

### Code Quality Checks

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

**Linting with Ruff:**

```bash
uvx ruff check .
```

**Formatting with Ruff:**

```bash
uvx ruff format .
```

**Type checking with mypy:**

```bash
uv run mypy src/ tests/
```

**Run all checks before submitting:**

```bash
uvx ruff check . && uvx ruff format . && uv run mypy src/ tests/ && uv run pytest tests/
```

### Working with Cython Code

The core library is written in Cython (`.pyx` files). Key considerations:

- **Memory management**: C pointers must be manually freed (use `__dealloc__`)
- **Type conversions**: Helper functions handle Python ↔ C conversions
- **String encoding**: Python str ↔ UTF-8 bytes ↔ `FcChar8*`
- **After editing `.pyx` or `.pxd` files**: Rebuild with `uv sync --reinstall`

For detailed information about the codebase architecture, internal APIs, and advanced patterns, see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

## Submitting Changes

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names with prefixes:

- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Test additions or modifications

Example: `feature/add-charset-comparison` or `fix/memory-leak-in-pattern`

### Commit Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```text
type: brief description

Optional longer description explaining the change in more detail.
```

**Types:**

- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring without functionality changes
- `test:` - Test additions or modifications
- `ci:` - CI/CD pipeline changes
- `deps:` - Dependency updates

**Examples:**

```text
docs: Add explanation of what fontconfig is to README

fix: Resolve memory leak in Pattern deallocation

feat: Add CharSet support for Unicode character sets
```

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch** from `main`
2. **Make your changes** following the code style guidelines
3. **Add or update tests** for your changes
4. **Update documentation** if you're changing user-facing functionality
5. **Update CHANGELOG.md** following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format for user-facing changes
6. **Run all tests and quality checks** (linting, formatting, type checking)
7. **Push your branch** and create a pull request

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Fill out the pull request template completely
- Link any related issues
- Ensure all CI checks pass
- Respond to code review feedback promptly
- Keep pull requests focused on a single change
- Squash commits if requested by maintainers

### Code Review

- All pull requests require review before merging
- Maintainers will provide constructive feedback
- Be open to suggestions and willing to make changes
- Reviews may take a few days depending on complexity

## Release Process

**Note**: This section is for maintainers. Contributors should focus on submitting pull requests for features and fixes.

The project uses a **pull request-based release workflow**:

### Creating a Release

1. **Create a release branch** from main:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b release/vX.Y.Z
   ```

2. **Update version** in `src/fontconfig/__init__.py`:

   ```python
   __version__ = "X.Y.Z"
   ```

3. **Update CHANGELOG.md**:
   - Change `## [Unreleased]` to `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`
   - Or add new version section with changes categorized under Fixed/Added/Changed/Documentation
   - Use concise 1-2 line entries for each change

4. **Update lock file**:

   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

5. **Create pull request**:

   ```bash
   git add src/fontconfig/__init__.py CHANGELOG.md uv.lock
   git commit -m "Bump version to X.Y.Z"
   git push -u origin release/vX.Y.Z
   gh pr create --title "Release vX.Y.Z" --body "Release summary..."
   ```

6. **Merge after approval**:
   - Wait for CI checks to pass
   - Get code review approval
   - Merge to main (**NEVER commit directly to main**)

7. **Create git tag and GitHub Release** (after merge):

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git tag vX.Y.Z
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   gh release create vX.Y.Z --title "Release X.Y.Z" --notes-from-tag
   ```

8. **PyPI publishing happens automatically** when the GitHub Release is created

### Release Branch Naming

- Use `release/vX.Y.Z` format (e.g., `release/v1.0.1`)
- This ensures consistency and clarity

### Important Notes

- NEVER commit version bumps directly to main
- Always use a pull request for releases
- The GitHub Actions workflow automatically publishes to PyPI when a release is created
- See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for detailed technical documentation
